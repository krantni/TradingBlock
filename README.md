# The Trading Block

A Trading Block for use with fantasy football leagues that use [Sleeper](https://sleeper.app/)

To solve a feature gap provided by the native Sleeper fantasy application, I built a React based UI that allows each fantasy team to show players that each team is willing to trade (i.e. a trading block). The interface takes in a Sleeper fantasy football league id and creates an orchestration between Sleeper APIs and each individual team to identify players by their nickname given by the team owners. With feedback from users, I added showing all players on a team, each owner's avatar, the individual league name as title and tab name. Over the lifetime of the project, Iâ€™ve had around 3,000 total users with around 75 users daily at the peak of usage.
